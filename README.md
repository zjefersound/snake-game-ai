# Reinforcement learning with PyTorch and Pygame

This is a Deep Learning project made following the [freeCodeCamp.org tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds) 

## What was made?
The project combines concepts from [Q Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-explained-visually-part-4-q-learning-step-by-step-b65efb731d3e) and [Deep Q Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-explained-visually-part-5-deep-q-networks-step-by-step-5a5317197f4b#:~:text=The%20Q%20Network%20is%20a,regular%20CNN%20or%20RNN%20architecture.).

- ```Game```: is the snake game itself with modifications to return the desired rewards and verify collisions from the ```agent```
- ```Agent```: is the "virtual player", that runs the game and trains the ```model``` 
- ```Model```: is the part of the application that saves the learned values into a Q table and predicts the next moves based on previous rewards.

## What is missing?
Improvements in reward values and how to dodge itself without getting locked.
